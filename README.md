# Data-Analyst-Learning-Journey
I’m learning Data Analysis with a focus on Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and data visualization (Matplotlib, Tableau). Through hands-on projects, I’m building skills in EDA, predictive modeling, and statistics. Excited to turn data into insights and connect with others in the field.
