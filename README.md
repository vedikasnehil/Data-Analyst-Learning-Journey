# My Data Analyst Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m **Vedika**, and I’m on a journey to become a **Data Analyst**. This repository documents my progress as I learn and apply key data analysis skills, including **Python**, **SQL**, **Data Visualization**, **Statistics**, and more. I’m committed to developing a strong foundation to turn raw data into actionable insights.

## What I’m Learning:
- **Python**: Working with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to manipulate, process, and visualize data.
- **SQL**: Writing complex queries to extract and analyze data from relational databases.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful charts and dashboards using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Tableau**.
- **Statistics**: Building a foundation in statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Exploring machine learning techniques for data-driven predictions.

## My Approach:
I focus on hands-on projects to apply what I learn and document my progress through real-world datasets. Data analysis is an ever-evolving field, so I am committed to continuous learning, taking courses, reading books, and following industry experts to stay updated.

## Why I’m Here:
Data analysis offers endless possibilities to uncover hidden patterns, improve processes, and support business decisions. By honing my skills, I hope to contribute to data-driven decision-making and solve real-world problems.

## Getting Started:
Clone this repository to explore my projects and code. I’ll continue uploading new content as I progress. Feel free to reach out for feedback, advice, or collaboration!
